## About

Program for Procedure Identification

A simple project developed in C# that, using two directories containing .SQL files, traverses both paths and compares the file names. The program identifies which files are present in both directories and which are missing in one of the paths.

At the end, the program generates two output files: one containing the names of the files found in both directories and another with the names of the files missing in one of the paths.

The project uses file manipulation, lists, as well as features like LINQ and Regex to optimize comparison and data processing.
